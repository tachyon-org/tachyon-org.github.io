<p>The success of DOE “big science” is increasingly tied to data analysis on extreme-scale
distributed computing infrastructure. The DOE High Energy Physics (HEP) program in
Neutrino and Collider science has been a key driver in applying and adapting
data-intensive science and simulation codes to extreme-scale platforms. These complex,
highly distributed workflows will continue to push the limits of current and future
extreme-scale systems, especially as they evolve to utilize increasingly sophisticated
AI/ML techniques for their data analysis. For example, the next generation of neutrino
oscillation experiments, led by the DUNE experiment, are based on the liquid argon time
project chamber technology. These detectors generate petabytes of high-resolution image
data that capture high-energy, complex interactions of neutrinos on argon nuclei and allow
for the measurement of fundamental parameters in the neutrino mixing model. The expected
data rates for the DUNE far detectors (located 1,000 miles from FNAL) are capable of
producing 6 GB of readout data per 5 milliseconds, providing a resolution, fidelity, and
data volume nearly 300 times greater than the equivalent interactions being captured with
the current generation technologies. Components of this high-fidelity experimental data
stream are intended to be analyzed in near real-time, requiring leadership-class computing
resources to do so. The hierarchy of complex, high-performance computing, network, and
storage components, as well as pathways from the experimental and leadership computing
facilities, need to be <em>modeled</em>, <em>analyzed</em>, and <em>tuned</em> to meet the necessary response
times and resiliency to disruption under nominal and atypical operational conditions.</p>

<p>To address this modeling grand challenge and build on past successful collaborations, the
<strong>Tachyon Project</strong> five-institution team proposes a framework that enables the scalable
modeling, simulation, and validation of key performance characteristics for the Fermilab
(FNAL) to Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF) distributed infrastructure and
associated HEP workflows. Our proposed framework is a multi-scale HEP workflow simulation
model that will accurately model and predict the end-to-end workflow performance over the
wide range of timescales and job/system failure scenarios that a resilient distributed HEP
infrastructure must operate now and in the future.</p>

<p>The proposed research program is divided into Core Research Tasks (CRTs) and leverages
design outcomes from the DOE EXPRESS <em>Kronos</em> Project  as well as the CODES systems
modeling framework to integrate complementary modeling methodologies: <em>parallel
discrete-event simulation (PDES)</em>, <em>surrogate machine learning (ML) models</em> and <em>analytic
models</em> into an overall <em>scalable system model</em> (CRT T3). This scalable system model is
coupled with extensive facility-supported performance data (CRT T1), resilient job
scheduling (CRT T2), and highly informative visualization and performance analysis (CRT
T4).</p>

<p>The <strong>Tachyon Project</strong> will model the entire HEP distributed infrastructure and workflow
campaign by creating surrogate ML models that are trained using both historical facility
data as well as massively parallel CODES-generated simulation data that has been validated
using extensive interactive visualization and analysis of the data and models via facility
performance data repositories. By leveraging validated, high-fidelity CODES simulation
data, we are able to dramatically increase the predictive range of surrogate ML models
beyond the preset job and system configurations contained within current historical
performance data repositories.</p>

<p>To capture the importance of resiliency, job placement, and scheduling in our scalable
system modeling framework, the CQSim scheduling simulator will be extended and integrated
with CODES to enable workflow-centric/facility-centric scheduling and reliability
modeling. To address the need for understanding phenomena in both the real distributed
infrastructure and the scalable system model, visual analytic methods will be developed
for the facility performance data, systems simulators, and surrogate models.</p>

<h2 id="project-impact">Project Impact</h2>

<p>Our proposed scalable system model will have a target accuracy of 90% and perform
significantly faster than existing high-fidelity modeling approaches, yielding a highly
valuable “what-if” planning tool for future distributed HEP experiments. More broadly,
<em>scalable modeling</em> of distributed HEP systems and exploring their stability will allow us
to design workflow topologies and operational envelopes which will match the mission
demands of other distributed science domains. In turn, the Tachyon Project scalable system
modeling framework will maximize the impact of the DOE’s investment in distributed
infrastructures like FNAL and ALCF by improving their resiliency and increasing the rate
of scientific discoveries across the breadth of the DOE’s experimental and computing
resources.</p>
